1. Optimize (e.g. string literals, redundant code, etc.).
2. Add more comprehensive tests.
3. Test serializability (does it require implementing value serializers?)
4. Consider TimeZone offset in ExtendedDateTime calculations.
5. Make Local UTC Offset the default UTC Offset.
6. Split date parser and time parser.

Undecided:
1. Should ExtendedDateTime be a value type? Value types must have a public, paramaterless constructor which would leave the ExtendedDateTime in an invalid state unless a default date were chosen.
2. Add LocalExtendedDateTime for ExtendedDateTimes that have time components but no time zone specified?
3. Should throw exceptions when serializing to string? Is it possible for ExtendedDateTime state to always be valid so ExtendedDateTime would always serialize to string?
