Specific:
- Implement remaining ISO-8601:2004(E) features.
- Implement binary serialization test.

Ongoing:
- Optimize (e.g. string literals, redundant code, etc.).
- Improve robustness through tests.
- Performance testing.

Undecided:
- Move scientific notation from extended datetime to a separate class.

Backburner:
- Add support for seasons in date arithmetic. (More difficult than it seems.)
