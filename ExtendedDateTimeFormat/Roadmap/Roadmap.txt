1. Optimize (e.g. string literals, redundant code, etc.).
2. Add more comprehensive tests.
3. Test serializability (does it require implementing value serializers?)
4. Consider TimeZone offset in ExtendedDateTime calculations.
5. Make Local UTC Offset the default UTC Offset.
6. Split date parser and time parser.

Undecided:
1. XML Documentation: Any value added?
2. Should ExtendedDateTime be a value type? 
3. Should the ExtendedDateTime properties be read-only?
4. Add LocalExtendedDateTime for ExtendedDateTimes that have time components but no time zone specified?
5. Should throw exceptions when serializing to string? Is it possible for ExtendedDateTime state to always be valid so ExtendedDateTime would always serialize to string?
